# Surveillance Capitalism

- engineered as undetectable

## Data Robbery

- Digital traces
- Residual data: waste → predictive data
    - Train to predict human behavior
    - **Behavioral Surplus**: more than needed to improve services
        - Extraction: <mark>scale, scope, surplus</mark>
➡️ Case: Supermarket predict girl is pregnant before she did using purchase records of shampoos
- Hidden processes
    - Purposes / customers of recognition software not disclosed
        - Authoritarian regime surveilance etc

## Subliminal Cues

- Obfuscate, misdirect users
- Change real-world behavior / emotion
- No user awareness
➡️ Pokemon Go: <mark>footfall</mark> click-thru rate IRL

> Lure modules

- Lure users into shops so they can pay money
    - Automate behavior of players

## Lack of Transparency and Responsibility

- Google nest thermostat: only functions when agreed to privacy agreements
- No responsbility for data sold to third parties
- Deny wrongdoing
    - Google deny microphone in nest
        - "deny until habituate"
        - Adapt otherwise

## Capitalism

- Variety of data: cars, home appliances, etc.
- To obtain surveillance capitalization, all companies are transitioning to surveillance capitalism
    - Ford cars
- Commercial (Facebook, Google) and political (Cambridge Analytica) outcomes
- Public operation (We love privacy) vs shadow operation (all Facebook users should not have legitimate expectation of privacy in court cases)

## Faustian Bargain

- Trade off between technology convenience and no privacy and self-determination
Surveillance capitalism as a market dynamic vs political checks and balance
- GDPR
