# Contractarianism Crash Course

## The State of Nature

- Thomas Hobbes in 17th century
- No rules at all to govern behavior
- Not a great time
- Freedom at the cost of <mark>security</mark>

## Civil Society

- Rational people trade freedom for security
- **A contract**
- Morality as a result of
    1. Free
    2. Self-interested
    3. Rational
people living together (benefits of co-operating)
➡️ Morality is not real! Only when people agree it becomes real and binding
➡️ Change of morality in groups (modify the contract)

## Contractarianism

- Agreement that benefits each other
- Do not violate the free, rational agreements
- Explicit contract
- Implicit contract: not explicitly agreed to
    - e.g. citizens born in a country follow laws of that country
- The **common pot**
- Necessity of freedom

## Prisoner's Dillema

- Cooperation only works when you trust other contractor
- Defection: break the contract to look after self interests
    - less likely among people who know each other
