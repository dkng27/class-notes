# Week 1 - What is Technology?

## New vs Old

New tech and old tech are both tech: both a well and smartphones are technologies.

## Two views on technology

1. **Instrumental Theory**: instrument that humans use as means to their ends
    - Prominent in Engineering point of view
    - Value-neutral

2. **Anthropological Theory**: technology as parts of distinctively human activities
    - Anthropologists and social scientists

- Combining both: "the instrumental and anthropological definition of technology", technologies as means to ends within human activities (Heidegger 1977)

## The view on robots

- Joanna Bryson: computer scientist and roboticist âž¡ ethics professor - Book "Robots Should Be Slaves" - Robot as a tool: servants/slaves of humans, can be bought or sold - Should not create machines with humanlike qualities
  - e.g., experience suffering, sensitive in ways like a human
  - So that we don't have moral responsibilities / duties towards then - Example: robot Sophia, _humanoid_ robot, given honorary citizenship of Saudi Arabia - Face and imitate human speech - Problematic: treated as if it were a human, but can be turned on and off (?)

  > Bryson has **normative version of instrumental theory of technology**

- _normative_: what we should and should not do;

- _instrumental_: tech as tools

## "Post-Phenomenology"

Phenomenology: reflection on life start with real life phenomena instead of abstract philosophical theories

**Post**-phenomenology: how tech shape how we experience reality, ourselves, and what we are able to do or aim for
    - Don Ihde, Bruno Latour, Peter-Paul Verbeek

Sociologists and philosophers disagree with instrumental theory of tech:

- Analyze human practices involving technologies
- How tech around us affects us
- Tech are not completely value-neutral

## Mediation theory

Technologies as a medium between us and what we perceive and what we do

- Shapes our perception and experience (of the world and ourselves)
  - Visual experience when wearing glasses our looking at photos
  - What we pay attention to in life shaped by tech we use
    - Algorithmic recommendations
