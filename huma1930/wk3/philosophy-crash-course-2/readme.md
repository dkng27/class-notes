# Kantian and Utilitarian theories

## Religious View vs Kantian View

* Divine Command Theory: good or bad determined by God
* Natural Law Theory: Moral preloaded by God

## Kantian Theory (Emmanuel Kant)

* Morality is constant, even in different religions
* Hypothetical Imperatives: `if-then` rules to achieve what you want

> Categorical Imperatives: Commands you **MUST** follow regardless of desires.

* <mark>Moral Obligation</mark> derived from pure reason

### Formulations

* "Different ways to look at the same idea"

1. Universalizability principle
    * > Universal actions without contradictions
    * If you can do it, so can everyone else
    * ➡ don't make exception for yourself
    * Unintuitive: cannot lie even for a good cause
2. The formula of humanity
    * > Humanity as an end, not as a **MERE** means (only benefit me)
    * Ok to use people but recognize humanity (consent)
    * People has autonomy: self-governance


## Utilitarianism

### Kill a killer?

* Batman as Kantian ethics
    * Sticking to moral rulebook: no killing
* Utilitarianism: focus on <mark>consequences</mark> instead of intent of actions
    > "Action should be measured in terms of Happiness, Pleasure they produce"

### Principle of Utility

* **Hedonistic** moral theory: pursue pleasure and avoid pain
    Other-regarding: most overall happiness, different from egoism
* Interest of self is not special in group
* ➡️ act like distant observer

### Critique of utilitarianism

* Kill 1 to save 19?
    * No moral theory should demand to take another one's life?

### Branches

* Act util-imsm: classical util-ism
    * ➡️ <mark>In any situation</mark>, choose the action produces greatest good for the greatest number
    * Again, kill 1 to save 5?
* Rule util-ism
    * We ought to <mark>live by rules</mark> that are <mark>in general</mark> likely to lead to the greatest good for the greatest number
    * Refrain from act that maximize utility in the *short* run and follow rules that maximize utility *most of the time*.
