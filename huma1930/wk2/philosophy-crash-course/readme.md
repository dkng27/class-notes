# Philosophy crash course

## On virtual theory

- Aristotle
- Humans have an end goal (function), just like things ➡ human essence
    - rational and social
    - ➡ use reason and get along with others
- Virtue is a character / habit that leads to consistent good behavior; it does not entail specific guidelines or rules
    - skill, way of living, through experience
    - practical wisdom
    - part of character through repeated action
    - follow moral exemplars
- Do the:
    - right thing
    - at right time
    - in the right way
    - in right place
    - to right people

- The <mark>Golden Mean</mark>
    - always between extreme excess and extreme deficiency

- Eudaimonia
    - achieved through having virtue
    - "life well-lived, human flourishing"
    - "happiness through constant effort and improvement"

## Living a good life

### Two perspectives

1. Through yourself
2. Through the people around you

### On value

- Sisyphus
- We are all Sisyphus, but we can assign value / meaning to the things we do
    - nothing / everything you do matters
- Existentialists: "your life is in your hands"

### The experience machine

- Robert Nozick in early 20th century
- Hedonist vs realness

### Ancient Greeks vs Modern French philosophy

- "Existence before essence" vs "Human essence"

### Why philosophy

- Many philosophers disagree with each other
- Those who "ask why", "challenge that doesn't seem right",
"listen and be ready to accept new truths if evidence is there"
