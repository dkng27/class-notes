## Utilitarianism

### Kill a killer?

* Batman as Kantian ethics
    * Sticking to moral rulebook: no killing
* Utilitarianism: focus on <mark>consequences</mark> instead of intent of actions
    > "Action should be measured in terms of Happiness, Pleasure they produce"

### Principle of Utility

* **Hedonistic** moral theory: pursue pleasure and avoid pain
    Other-regarding: most overall happiness, different from egoism
* Interest of self is not special in group
* ➡️ act like distant observer

### Critique of utilitarianism

* Kill 1 to save 19?
    * No moral theory should demand to take another one's life?

### Branches

* Act utilitarnism: classical util-ism
    * ➡️ <mark>In any situation</mark>, choose the action produces greatest good for the greatest number
    * Again, kill 1 to save 5?
* Rule util-ism
    * We ought to <mark>live by rules</mark> that are <mark>in general</mark> likely to lead to the greatest good for the greatest number
    * Refrain from act that maximize utility in the *short* run and follow rules that maximize utility *most of the time*.
