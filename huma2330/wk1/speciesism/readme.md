## Speciesism

> Discrimination against animals -> treat people of other races as animals

> Race relations -> animal relations

To strip subject of humanity

- WW2 propaganda:
    - US: Gorillas, Chimpanzees
        - Enemies as <mark>bestial</mark> animals, to be defeated
        - Turned Japan into "cute" chimp after defeating it
    - Japan: Enemies as demons (less animal like, but still nonhuman)
        - People of invaded areas as <mark>friendly, cute</mark> animals to be used as <mark>willing and cooperative</mark> labor
        - Wartime media portrayed occupation of Asian countries as "racial liberation"
        - Animals become "companion species"

> Animation full of speciesism

## Plasmaicity and invulnerability

- Ability to morph body into different life forms on screen
- resistant to injury and death, even if violence done to it
    - tom and jerry
- animators like using animals because humans are less perceptive of such movements in animals than humans

> Mediatization: extinct species in real life re-appear on screen, perhaps more so than ever
